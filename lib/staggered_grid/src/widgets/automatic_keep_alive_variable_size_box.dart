          //    parent data information to our child because we don't _have_ a

          //    new value, but it's too late.
          //
          //  * A deep descendant in another build scope just got yanked, and in
          //    the process notified us. We could apply new parent data
          //    information, but it may or may not get applied this frame,
          //    depending on whether said child is in the same layout scope.
          //
          //  * A descendant is being moved from one position under us to
          //    another position under us. They just notified us of the removal,
          //    at some point in the future they will notify us of the addition.
          //    We don't want to do anything. (This is why we check that
          //    _handles is still empty below.)
          //
          //  * We're being notified in the paint phase, or even in a post-frame
          //    callback. Either way it is far too late for us to make our
          //    parent lay out again this frame, so the garbage won't get
          //    collected this frame.
          //
          //  * We are being torn out of the tree ourselves, as is our
          //    descendant, and it notified us while it was being deactivated.
          //    We don't need to do anything, but we don't know yet because we
